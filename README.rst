bitrot
======

Detects bit rotten files on the hard drive to save your precious photo
and music collection from slow decay.

Usage
-----

Go to the desired directory and simply invoke::

  $ bitrot

This will start digging through your directory structure recursively
indexing all files found. The index is stored in a ``.bitrot.db`` file
which is a SQLite 3 database.

Next time you run ``bitrot`` it will add new files and update the index
for files with a changed modification date. Most importantly however, it
will report all errors, e.g. files that changed on the hard drive but
still have the same modification date.

All paths stored in ``.bitrot.db`` are relative so it's safe to rescan
a folder after moving it to another drive. Just remember to move it in
a way that doesn't touch modification dates. Otherwise the checksum
database is useless.

Performance
-----------

Obviously depends on how fast the underlying drive is.  Historically
the script was single-threaded because back in 2013 checksum
calculations on a single core still outran typical drives, including
the mobile SSDs of the day.  In 2020 this is no longer the case so the
script now uses a process pool to calculate SHA1 hashes and perform
`stat()` calls.

No rigorous performance tests have been done.  Scanning a ~1000 file
directory totalling ~5 GB takes 2.2s on a 2018 MacBook Pro 15" with
a AP0512M SSD.  Back in 2013, that same feat on a 2015 MacBook Air with
a SM0256G SSD took over 20 seconds.

On that same 2018 MacBook Pro 15", scanning a 60+ GB music library takes
24 seconds.  Back in 2013, with a typical 5400 RPM laptop hard drive
it took around 15 minutes.  How times have changed!

Tests
-----

There's a simple but comprehensive test scenario using
`pytest <https://pypi.org/p/pytest>`_ and
`pytest-order <https://pypi.org/p/pytest-order>`_.

Install::

  $ python3 -m venv .venv
  $ . .venv/bin/activate
  (.venv)$ pip install -e .[test]

Run::

  (.venv)$ pytest -x
